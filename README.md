Note that the code in [this repo](https://github.com/IoTAccessControl/RapidPatch/tree/ArtifactEvaluation) is the version for hotpatching MCU-based embedded devices.
We have another version for hotpatching [Linux server programs](https://github.com/eBPF-Research/eBPF-Linux-Hotpatch).
It will be fully open source soon.
